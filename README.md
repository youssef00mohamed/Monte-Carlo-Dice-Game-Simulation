# Monte Carlo Dice Game Simulation

This project simulates a dice game using Monte Carlo methods to analyze win probabilities and ending balances based on random dice rolls.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Simulate a dice game where players bet on whether two dice show the same number.
- **Simulation Details:**
  - Players start with a balance of $1000 and can bet $1 per roll.
  - If the dice show the same number, the player wins $4 times their bet; otherwise, they lose their bet.
  - Simulations are run to track win probabilities and ending balances over multiple runs.
- **Visualization:**
  - The project includes visualizations of balance changes over the course of simulations.
- **Insights:**
  - Provides insights into average win probabilities and ending balances after a specified number of simulations.
 
## Requirements

- Programming Language: `Python 3.x`
- Libraries: `matplotlib`, `random`

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youssef00mohamed/monte-carlo-dice-game.git
   cd monte-carlo-dice-game

2. **Run the simulation:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook (monte carlo dice game.ipynb) using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
   - Execute the cells to run the simulation and view the results.
     
4. **View results:**
   - The notebook will display visualizations of balance changes and print average win probabilities and ending balances based on the simulations.
